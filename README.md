The Challenge: Water

Water is a precious commodity that impacts all aspects of life. For some, this resource is readily available and in great supply. In the agriculture industry, however, that is not always the case. Access and proper use of water is imperative for the sustainability, growth and livelihood of agriculture. How can you make a difference and find solutions for these issues?

Your challenge is to come up with a solution to any aspect of this problem, all while considering the following:

Applicability of broadband use in rural America where there is limited access and what are the alternatives?

How can open USDA data be used in the decision making process, machine learning, or artificial intelligence models and applications?

Cybersecurity to detect, prevent, mitigate and protect against threats.
